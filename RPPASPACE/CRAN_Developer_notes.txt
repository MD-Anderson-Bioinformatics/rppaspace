Creating the package for CRAN

Use PDFs for vignette documentation for CRAN.  It prefers PDFs to HTML vignettes.
Make sure GhostScript and PanDoc are installed and the proper environment variables are set up properly for them to work.
If Ghostscript isn't found the PDFs will be compreessed by qpdf but won't be compressed as much as desired by CRAN.

Build the package with the compressed manual and vignettes.  
Within R or RStudio
devtools::build(vignettes=TRUE, manual=TRUE, args='--compact-vignettes="gs+qpdf"')
or from the command line:
R CMD build --compact-vignettes="gs+qpdf" RPPASPACE

From command line:
Run CRAN check against built package, not the source directory or you'll probably get many notes, warnings, and/or errors.
R CMD check --as-cran RPPASPACE_1.0.7.tar.gz


Just a reminder if installing manually from local source package. (Not needed for CRAN)
Within R:
install.packages('RPPASPACE_1.0.7.tar.gz', repos=NULL, build_vignettes = TRUE)
