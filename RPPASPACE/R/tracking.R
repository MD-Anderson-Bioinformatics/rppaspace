    ## tracking is a dataframe used to track the points data from a slide and how they are used
    ## Sample points are loaded with much of the information coming from the sample file for a single slide
    ## Additional information is either loaded from a design file or from object parameters passed in the R Script
    ## This design-related information is used to modify all slides that are part of a run of the software
    ## These sources of information determine which points from the same are used for the following:
    ## 1) Negative controls used to filter positive control points
    ## 2) Positive control points used to perform spatial adjustments on sample points
    ## 3) Sample points that are used to create a curve to represent the data for one slide/antibody
    ## 4) Sample points to fit to the curve created in step 3 above and provided as textual and graphical output
    ## 5) Positive Control points treated as noise values and fit to the curve and provided as textual output 
    ## 6) List of any points that caused issues during the above processing which have output values that should be suspect (badPoint)
